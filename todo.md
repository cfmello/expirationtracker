## Todo List

### Phase 1: Research and plan mobile app architecture
- [x] Research suitable mobile app frameworks (React Native, Flutter, etc.)
- [x] Research local storage options for React Native (SQLite, AsyncStorage, Realm, etc.)
- [x] Research push notification solutions for React Native (Firebase, Expo Notifications, etc.)
- [x] Research architectural patterns for mobile apps (MVVM, Redux, Context API, etc.)
- [x] Document chosen technologies and architectural plan

### Phase 2: Set up React Native development environment
- [x] Install Node.js, npm/yarn
- [x] Install Expo CLI or React Native CLI
- [x] Create new React Native project
- [x] Configure project for iOS and Android development

### Phase 3: Design app UI/UX and create wireframes
- [x] Sketch main screens (item list, add item, item detail)
- [x] Define color palette and typography
- [x] Create wireframes/mockups for key screens
- [x] Get user feedback on design (N/A for now)

### Phase 4: Implement core app functionality and database
- [x] Set up local database
- [x] Implement item model and CRUD operations
- [x] Develop item list view
- [x] Develop add item form
- [x] Develop item detail view

### Phase 5: Add push notifications and local storage

- [x] Allow users to define custom categories

### Phase 7: Add dark mode and polish UI
- [x] Implement dark mode toggle
- [x] Refine UI elements for responsiveness
- [x] Ensure consistent design across platforms

### Phase 8: Test app functionality and prepare for deployment
- [x] Conduct unit and integration tests
- [x] Test on various iOS and Android devices/emulators
- [x] Optimize performance
- [x] Prepare build for App Store and Google Play

### Phase 9: Create deployment documentation and deliver final app
- [x] Document deployment process
- [x] Provide instructions for testing
- [x] Deliver source code and build files
