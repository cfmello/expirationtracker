# Mobile App Architecture Plan

## 1. Framework: React Native

React Native is chosen for its cross-platform capabilities, allowing a single codebase for both iOS and Android applications. This will significantly reduce development time and effort while maintaining a near-native user experience.

## 2. Local Storage: Realm

Realm is selected as the local database solution. It is an object-oriented database that is fast, efficient, and designed specifically for mobile applications. It offers a more robust and performant solution compared to AsyncStorage for structured data and complex queries, which will be beneficial for managing item expiration data.

## 3. Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) will be used for handling push notifications. FCM provides a reliable and scalable way to deliver notifications to both iOS and Android devices, even when the app is closed. This is crucial for the app's core functionality of reminding users about approaching expiration dates.

## 4. Architectural Pattern: MVVM with React Context API

The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern will be implemented to ensure a clean separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability. The React Context API will be utilized for state management, providing a lightweight and efficient way to share data across components without the need for a more complex state management library like Redux, given the app's relatively simple state requirements.

### MVVM Breakdown:

*   **Model:** Represents the data and business logic (e.g., `Item` data structure, expiration calculation logic).
*   **View:** The UI components (React Native components) that display the data and capture user input.
*   **ViewModel:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It exposes data from the Model to the View and handles View-related logic and user interactions. It will use the React Context API to provide data to the Views.

This architecture will promote modularity, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain the application.
