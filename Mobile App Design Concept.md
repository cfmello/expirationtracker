# Mobile App Design Concept

## 1. User Interface (UI) Principles

Our design philosophy for the Expiration Tracker app centers on **simplicity, intuitiveness, and efficiency**. The UI will be clean, minimalist, and user-friendly, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.

*   **Clean Layout:** Ample whitespace and clear visual hierarchy to reduce cognitive load.
*   **Intuitive Navigation:** Easy-to-understand navigation flows with clear labels and consistent placement of interactive elements.
*   **Minimalist Aesthetic:** Focus on essential elements, avoiding clutter and unnecessary embellishments.
*   **Responsive Design:** Layouts will adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations on both iOS and Android devices.

## 2. Color Palette

The app will utilize a calming and modern color palette. A primary accent color will be used for interactive elements and key information, while a neutral palette will dominate the background and text.

*   **Primary Accent:** A vibrant but not overpowering shade of blue or green (e.g., `#4CAF50` - Material Green or `#2196F3` - Material Blue) to signify action and important dates.
*   **Neutral Backgrounds:** Light gray (`#F5F5F5`) for light mode and dark gray (`#212121`) for dark mode to provide a comfortable viewing experience.
*   **Text Colors:** Dark gray (`#424242`) for primary text in light mode, and light gray (`#E0E0E0`) for primary text in dark mode, ensuring readability.

## 3. Typography

We will use a modern, sans-serif typeface that is highly readable across various screen sizes.

*   **Font Family:** Roboto (for Android) and San Francisco (for iOS) will be the primary fonts, leveraging native platform fonts for optimal performance and consistency with system aesthetics. Alternatively, a single cross-platform font like 'Inter' or 'Open Sans' could be considered for a unified look.
*   **Font Sizes:** A clear typographic scale will be established for headings, subheadings, body text, and small labels to ensure visual hierarchy.

## 4. Key Screens and Wireframes

### 4.1. Item List Screen

*   **Purpose:** Provides an overview of all tracked items, their remaining days, and categories.
*   **Elements:**
    *   **Header:** App title ("Expiration Tracker"), search icon, and potentially a filter/sort icon.
    *   **Item List:** Scrollable list of cards or rows. Each row displays:
        *   Item Name (prominently displayed)
        *   Remaining Days (e.g., "30 days remaining", "Expired!")
        *   Optional Category Tag (small, colored tag)
    *   **Floating Action Button (FAB):** A large circular button with a "+" icon at the bottom right for adding new items.

### 4.2. Add Item Screen

        *   Remaining Days (large, prominent display)
    *   **Action Buttons:** "Mark as Replaced" (resets start date to today) and "Remove Item" (deletes the item).

## 5. User Experience (UX) Considerations

*   **Ease of Use:** Minimize steps for common actions (e.g., adding an item).
*   **Clear Feedback:** Provide visual cues and messages for successful actions or errors.
*   **Notifications:** Implement timely and persistent push notifications for approaching expiration dates.
*   **Search and Filter:** Enable quick access to specific items through search and category filters.
*   **Dark Mode:** Provide an option for dark mode to reduce eye strain in low-light environments.

## 6. Accessibility

*   **High Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability.
*   **Scalable Text:** Support dynamic type sizes for users with visual impairments.
*   **Touch Target Sizes:** Buttons and interactive elements will have adequate touch target areas.
